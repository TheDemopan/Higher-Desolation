A faction dedicated to study of the [[Temporally Shifted Ethereal Plane]], as opposed to the [[Astrum Seekers]]

While not technically lawful, their understanding and unending study of the Ethereal Plane allows them to see every possible future outcome through the [[Color Curtains]]. They can anticipate every path and experience some small form of omnipotence. It's this full transparency that makes them unlikely to betray each other.

Most Ethereal Sages do not understand history to the extent the Astrum Seekers do, but they can appreciate the presence of Law, despite not really experiencing it themselves.

The Ethereal Sages believe that Law can bring the triverse to a higher state, that Law is the missing ingredient to end painful, unrelentless chaos. They believe many mortals can rise to power and govern aspects and facets of the natural multiverse, perhaps plenty of their own.
