A faction dedicated to study of the [[Temporally Shifted Astral Plane]] as opposed to the [[Ethereal Sages]]

They somehow manifested elements of Law and formed social hierarchies and guidelines. They are most notable for their almost celestial appearance, with sky blue robes and glowing halos and motifs of space and stars.

Most Astrum Seekers understand the history of the Triverse to an unfathomable level due to their expeditions to the Astral Plane and understanding of [[Color pools]] and their reflections. It's a fraction of these expeditions that somehow result in the faction being exposed to Law.

The Astrum Seekers believe that Law can bring the triverse to a higher state, that Law is the missing ingredient to end painful, unrelentless chaos. They believe that one, exceptional mortal can rise to power and govern the triverse, perhaps one of their own.
