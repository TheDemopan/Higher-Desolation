Milwan Vupo

Current commander of [[Haven's Glimpse]]

Worked his way up the "ranks" with powerful magic. His prowess in combat made him formidable in defending himself in the chaos of the [[Entropic Field of Neutral]]. Don't let his age fool you, his mind remains sharp and his cunning is no less fatigued.
