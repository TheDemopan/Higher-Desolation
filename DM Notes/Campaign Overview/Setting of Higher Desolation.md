**Higher Desolation** is a world shattered by the cataclysmic event known as the [[Divine Unravelling]], a cosmic upheaval that ripped apart the fundamental structure of the multiverse. In this fractured realm, gods have vanished, their divine influence extinguished, leaving a void of lawlessness and chaos. The world now exists within the ever-changing **Entropic Fields**, where the once-stable planes of existence have become unpredictable, constantly shifting domains. At the heart of this fragmented cosmos lies the enigmatic [[Triversal Globe]], a luminous, tricolored sphere. Its core is the [[Temporally Shifted Astral Plane]], a repository of history and past events. Wrapped around it is the [[Temporally Shifted Ethereal Plane]], where myriad potentialities coalesce, reflecting the could-have-beens. Together, they form the mystical fabric of reality, allowing glimpses into the past and future, yet these reflections remain elusive, untamed, and fraught with peril.

Within the Entropic Fields, society and order are fleeting, and the absence of divine guidance has given rise to moral ambiguity and unpredictable upheavals. The people of Higher Desolation navigate this tumultuous landscape, seeking purpose and stability amid the chaos. It is a world where individual choices and actions carry profound consequences, and where the remnants of a forgotten era are strewn across the ever-changing terrain. As players venture forth into Higher Desolation, they must grapple with the allure of ancient power, the dangers of moral decay, and the opportunity to reshape a fractured world. In this realm of shattered planes and unpredictable reflections, their choices will shape the course of history, and their quest for answers will unravel the mysteries hidden within the Triversal Globe.
