A fading and rising outpost that seems to pop up somewhere in the [[Entropic Field of Neutral]] every once in a while. Despite the chaotic nature of the triverse, there is almost a pattern to where Haven's Glimpse sprouts, by bodies of water and where stars align.

It's characterized by the nigh nauseating presence of light, sky blue. It is seen on the robes of town "officials" and on all the tents.

Those who live here are offshoots of the [[Astrum Seekers]], thus the fleeting presence of Law in their system.
